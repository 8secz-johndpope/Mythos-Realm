# Mythos-Realm
A RTS style MOBA game built in the Unreal Engine 4. This has been my personal project since about February 2015, working on it in my free time.

This is all of the Unreal Engine source code that runs the game; however, this is just the base code and is generic. A lot of the magic happens in the blueprints created in the game for each of the characters.

Here are some videos of the code in action:
